# DevOps-on-IBM-Cloud-Tutorial
Development Operations (DevOps) is a software methodology that integrates application development and information technology (IT) operations.

Application development includes writing code, testing the code, building fixes, integrating the fixes, building the application, and deploying the application.

IT operations include managing the environment on which the applications run, providing computer power to the applications, and making the software secure, scale, and run more efficiently.

The issues arise because development and operations were traditionally separate groups, “living” in their own isolated world. DevOps blurs the lines between the development tasks and operational tasks by integrating processes and tools.

DevOps provides real value to the business. For example, it enables continuous delivery, so as soon as new application features are complete, they can be automatically rolled into production. In turn, this action reduces time-to-market, provides competitive advantages, and reduces cost.

DevOps automates the deployment of fixes after they are tested and approved. DevOps enables developers to customize and change applications quickly, improving customer satisfaction.

DevOps enables a more stable environment and better application quality. The combination of a shared code base, continuous integration, test-driven techniques, and automated deployments expose problems in application code, infrastructure, or configuration earlier.

In this lab, you explore DevOps services in IBM Cloud. The IBM Cloud catalog provides multiple tools for DevOps, but this exercise is focused on IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery. Continuous Delivery enables you to build, test, and deliver applications by using DevOps practices and industry-leading tools.

# Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you should be able to perform the following tasks:

Enable your application to use IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery.
Create a Git repository to manage your source code.
View and edit code in the Eclipse Orion Web integrated development environment (IDE).
Build and deploy code to IBM Cloud.
Test the application in IBM Cloud.
Prerequisites
You must have an IBM Cloud account in the US-South region.
